          For HTML, I have got experience before back in my secondary school. So it's not something super hard for me.
          But it still took sometime for me to recap what I have learnt before.

          As for CSS, I don't think I have heard of it before. But it's still quite fun to learn as it literally makes
          HTML more presentable.
          However, due to the continual 4-days working after the EA hands-on sessions, it delayed my process of
          learning CSS and of course, constructing this website.
          I think I will further study both HTML and CSS when I am free again, making a better looking website.

          I was really surprise when I get to know the existence of markdown. Thanks to John MacFarlane who created
          markdown language, making our life easier to do documentation. I have yet to try markdown out due the shortage
          of time, but I'm pretty sure sometime in the future I will document my notes, portfolio, technical designs in it.

          When I was a kid, Github is the kind of thing I will imagine and wish I have access to it, a place where I can
          upload things and share with my friends, colleagues, just anyone who know the link. As an example, I am putting
          My website on Github where my friends as well as my teachers can have look.
